Then I called El Mate.  The person on the phone used words like ""please"" and ""thank you,"" unlike the waiters where I currently stood.  When I got to El Mate, my table was before me with a ""Reserved"" sign.

Walter, the waiter, stated his recommendations.

The Empanadas were ok - I'm not a fan of deep fried empanadas though.  I prefer them baked.

The rice and beans were typical.

The short ribs, skirt steak, Mashed YUCCA, were out of this world.  

The service was EXCEPTIONAL.

This place would have gotten five stars if I liked the way the empanadas were cooked more.

Great night with great food and great service.","","2/10/2019","I was about to go to Libertador, but when my brother and I told the waiter ""we have reservations,"" the waiter abruptly said, ""Everybody has reservations at this time!"" and walked away.  To his credit, he did say after the second request, ""Look, if a table opens up, I'll take care of you"" and smiled, BUT...  this was 15 minutes after my first request which left me standing in front of the restaurant unattended.

We went to New York for [only] 2 days to celebrate my birthday. 

My husband and I are vegan; my sister and her husband are not but were open to anywhere we wanted to eat for my birthday. Yay!

I chose Modern Love Brooklyn based off their yummy looking gluten-free options. We arrived around 6:30pm on a Sunday evening, unknowing, reservations needed to be made! They were booked till 9pm! Rosalie, the hostess, mentioned she may have 4 seats at the bar in an hour. 

We decided to wait as we were at a loss because I am limited on my vegan/GF options and was really hoping for a good restaurant to enjoy my birthday dinner at. We were staying in LIC and had already spent the day in Times Square so going all the way back there just seemed wasteful. We decided the bar and an hour wait would have to do and felt grateful for even getting the opportunity to still eat there.

Within half an hour, Rosalie's beautiful face came up to us with a proposition that she had a table she could put us at but we would only have about an hour. We graciously and excitedly accepted!

The food was spectacular. We loved everything. My sister said she could easily go vegan with food like this! [Big win in the vegan world]. My-loves-meat-brother-in-law was very impressed and happy with the food. He and my sister said the mozzarella sticks were the best they have ever had! The ""Hen of the Woods Piccata"" was absolutely delicious and we all enjoyed the ""Chorizo Nachos"". The truffled poutine was only okay. 

Our waiter was Can; he was really nice and helpful when we chose dessert. I needed gluten-free so only had a couple of options; he suggested the Almond Joy Pie. 
Oh my. That pie.
It was divine. We all loved it and I really was sad I had to share most of it with my husband. Can was sweet and brought it to me with a lit birthday candle so I was able to make a birthday wish and all. :]

Big thanks to Rosalie for going above and beyond to seat us. She is a gem and I appreciate her professionalism and kindness.","","2/20/2019","Oh where to begin!

They allow you to BYOB but charge $10 corking fee per bottle-a little steep, but MUCH cheaper versus dipping into their wine selection (I believe the cheapest red was ~45/bottle). The food was INCREDIBLE - probably the best grape leaves I've ever had. Sour, but fresh, and I could have eaten at least 10. The lamb shank was beautifully presented, and cooked to perfection. It was savory and almost falling off the bone. All of my dinner companions had similar feedback, and this restaurant is going on one of our

Everything about this place contributes to its authenticity. All our dishes looked like they were from someone's china cabinet - lovely, with flowers, and it made the whole meal feel more personal. Not sure if this is on purpose or not, but I loved it. Service is a little interesting - I took some of the initial aloofness as contributing to the authenticity, but can see why some yelpers get irritated. That said, as the food started coming and we got to speaking with the staff, they began to warm-up. This is TRULY some of the best Turkish food I've had in the US, and they take the compliments to heart. By the end, they were laughing with us.

Tiny restaurant inside - I would recommend making a reservation if you're going for dinner on a weekend. However, it's well worth it.

Two of us went for dinner and we ordered dinner for three because we could not decide which yummy entree to order! Plus two appetizers!

We started with the Mac and cheese and could not put down our spoons! We also had Jalapeno Hush Puppies as the other appetizer.

For entrees, we had Fried Chicken on Red Velvet waffles, Jambalaya, and BBQ brisket. OMG! Incredible! All three were so delicious I could not say one was better than the others! Get all three! We did!

All the service was top-notch and very attentive. We were here early Wednesday night but they seem like they'd be great any night.

Things I like:
2 eggs + veggie sausage. After I had this, I tried out multiple veggie sausages to replicate theirs. I they use the Morningstar Farms veggie sausage but I'm not 100% sure.
Pancakes: fluffy and tasty.
Mussels: Only at dinner. Mussels are hard to get wrong, but their sauce is quite flavorful

Just ok:
Veggie burger. Fine, but has a lot of lentils that make the texture a bit off.
Parmesan French toast. All the sauce makes it a bit soggy.","","2/23/2019","TL;DR: I love love love their vegetarian options at brunch and there are so many. Also so reasonably priced and never a wait. My favorite spot to go in GP.

I want to slap myself actually for allowing my pain in the ass girlfriend talking me out of getting it.  Ribeye was awesome.  Literally awesome. It's hard to say if it was the best ever because I was hungry. So you give a starving man a cracker it's gonna be the best cracker in history.  But it was good.  I know because she ate it all.

The French fries appeared to be fresh cut and fried. All the food was fresh and hot out of the pan. 
The energy from the time we entered was chill and full of positive vibes. The manager, Mike and the bar manager, Andy were both high energy. They were doing a good job making sure all of  the patrons felt like valued customers. 
Great location! Near the J train and walking distance over the Williamsburg Bridge

Ok. The pizza. Wow. Just wow. This is some GOOD pizza. I never knew what good pizza could be like until now. Juliana's has deliciously thin pizzas that have the perfect consistency of chewy yet crispy pizza dough and superbly fresh ingredients. Each ingredient can be tasted as noticeably high quality. I was able to scarf down half a large pizza without blinking. A beautifully made pizza, one I'd recommend for all to try.

Highly recommended, I will definitely be coming back another time.","","3/2/2019","I was very lucky to get in line early, because that line filled up real quick.

Nice, cozy but sophisticated atmosphere. We got seated at a booth for 4 people where you could see the kitchen behind a glass window. 

We weren't too impressed with the wagyu sashimi appetizer. The crab cake was pretty good and big enough to share. The porterhouse is decently priced at $50/pp (min. 2 orders). My cocktail- the yuzu rickey was a bit sour and tasted a bit average. The chocolate matcha cake was pretty good. Overall, a pretty good dinner.","","3/1/2019","Easily made a reservation here a day before, though it was for 5:30pm- right when they opened. Got crowded as the night went on.

I had noticed it before on a friend's Instagram story so was familiar with the name, but beyond that, really didn't know much about what to expect from this small, colorful, and lively Carroll Gardens establishment.

We walked in at 7.30pm and were told that there would be a 30 minute wait, so we put our names down and ventured out to Brooklyn Social nearby. When we got their call, we were starving but got seated immediately, excited because everything smelled so good.

Ugly Baby is not your average American Thai restaurant - the items on the menu are unique, interesting, and everything seemed appealing. Asked our table neighbors if they recommend any dishes in particular, and they named a few. One of them asked whether we were used to spicy food, and we said yes. As Bangladeshis, neither my friend nor I are daunted when people warn us about spicy food - rarely do we take these warnings seriously. We can handle A LOT of spice. We ordered three dishes - the server tried to warn us to order a 'mild' dish to neutralize the heat from the other dishes, but we didn't think it would really be THAT spicy.

We were wrong.

The shrimp, squid, and salted egg yolk arrived first - our favorite and a must-eat when you are here. The flavors are delicious and the sauce is SO flavorful, but it comes at a cost as we were soon breathing fire.

Next came the beef shank khao soi - a signature dish here. Personally I did not find as spicy as the first dish but this was absolutely delicious! The beef was incredibly tender and the broth super flavorful.

By the time we started eating the spicy chicken green curry with fresh birds eye chillis, our tongues were pretty numb and I couldn't taste that much of it so we had to take it home.

All in all - amazing food, incredible flavors, really fun vibe - but be prepared and only come here if you can actually handle the spice! Next time, I'll make sure to order the fish to add some more balance to the meal and make sure there's a combination of mild to hot flavors. 

The servers are friendly, helpful, and do a great job of keeping your glasses necessarily replenished with water at all times. I'll be back soon for more!","","1/7/2019","I usually don't venture out to Gowanus, so when I happened to be there with a friend one Sunday night, I proposed that we give Ugly Baby a try.

My first bite of it was a letdown. It was way too sweet and indulgent for me esp since it was literally drenched in a pool of syrup. I feel like I gained 10 lbs and 4 cavities after eating this. 

On the other hand, the pork chop and cheddar waffles were surprisingly good. The pork chop was sliced thick, crisply breaded and seasoned well, and cooked perfectly. I didn't taste too much cheddar in the waffles but I think it was made with a corn meal batter which was an interesting change in a good way. I'll have to return for dinner to try to chicken and waffles!

If you come here definitely get the buttermilk biscuits!! $6 for 2 of them that comes with butter and strawberry jam. They're huge, crispy on the outside and super soft on the inside.","","2/26/2019","I had really high hopes for the pecan French toast after reading all the reviews but my sister and I were disappointed.

My group ordered the beet ravioli, the special pasta of the day, a handmade pasta in a duck ragu sauce and the risotto of the day, made with scallops and mushroom. The two pastas were very good but the standout dish by far was the risotto. I'm afraid I may have been ruined forever by the risotto as nothing else will compare!

The only minus about this place is the bread... I did not think it was very good at all! I think they should source from somewhere else or try making a different kind which matches the quality of the food more.","","2/12/2019","Monday nights aren't really go out to eat nights for me but when my pasta loving friend invited me to Al Di La, I decided to skip my normal routine to go.

We figured we would give this a shot because we had heard how good it was. The wait was half the time so we put our name in. The great thing about Miss Ada is that they take your number and text you when your table is about to be ready. One thing to note about this restaurant is that the bar seating is not up for grabs, you have to wait to be seated there as well. 

When we came back, we were seated at the bar but had about 10 minutes to look over the menu so we had a good idea of what we wanted. We got the shakshuka, the Israeli eggs, and the whipped ricotta to start. The food came out incredibly fast, which we were very grateful for. The whipped ricotta was amazing! It was fresh and light and full of flavor. The drizzle of honey on top was magnificent and the zaatar spices were perfect. The sweet savory combination was truly delicious. My husband even loved it and isn't typically a huge fan of ricotta.  

We shared the shakshuka and the Israeli eggs and man oh man were they good. The flavors in each of the dishes were absolutely incredible. I loved the tomato sauce that came with the eggs. It was pretty much the shakshuka sauce; absolutely mouthwatering. The labne was SO SO SO GOOD. Everything was really just top notch here. I can not wait to come back.

I know they take reservations on Resy for dinner but I'm not sure about brunch. I'd check though before going, because it was packed!","","2/20/2019","My god this is a good restaurant.

If it's your birthday you can eat for free six days before or after your birthday, but you need to be a table of four. You should still reserve about a week in advance so you can get a table. You would be surprise it's still busy during the weekdays, but not as busy as the weekends.

I always leave room for my belly for their pudding with milk tea. It's a match made in heaven. During the weekends though they may run out since those are their busiest days. They also give you yakult after you finish eating.","","3/4/2019","Forever my favorite hotpot place !

Service was fantastic. Our server kept up with our non stop sarcasm and recommended a really lovely wine for the table.
Very pleased that we ended up here after the restaurant we wanted to go to, was closed. It was fate! Will 100% come back the next time I pay a visit to NYC!","","11/13/2018","Yep! 5 stars!

I was lucky enough to be taken here for my birthday dinner. This place is the real deal. Peter Luger is one of New York's longest running restaurants, having been established in 1887. After trying the food, it is understandably so. 
My friend made a reservation here (by phone only) a few weeks beforehand, and was only able to get a reservation at 5:45pm on a Sunday. She called a few days before the reservation to change it to a party of three, which they were able to accommodate. 
We arrived promptly at 5:45pm on the day of our reservation, and stepped into a long hall, reminiscent of a German beer hall. My friend was at the host's desk already, and after confirming our reservation, we were told to wait over near the bar. 
Peter Luger is also unlike other restaurants in that it rejects modernity by clinging to the past and old traditions. We noted that all the reservations were handwritten in a large notebook. Before five minutes passed, we were shown to our seats at a four person table in the midst of the dining room. 
The service here is brusque, but polite and efficient. We were brought glasses of water immediately, and copies of the menu. 
The menu style is simple: steak orders start at 2 people, and go up to 4 people, with a few additional entrees for variety, such as lamb chops. We decided on the steak for three, and started with the sizzling thick cut bacon to start, and a side of the baked potato with sour cream.
Complimentary bread and butter was also brought around right after ordering, however, both the bread and butter were cold and lackluster. 
The thick cut bacon was served shortly after, and was thick, as promised, and very tasty.
The main course came out as we were polishing off the bacon. The waiter brought it out on a sizzling plate, at the same time as the baked potato with sour cream. The steak was accompanied by a sweet fruit-based sauce, possibly cranberry. It was searingly hot, but we all dug in, and exclaimed immediately at its sheer perfection. It was cooked right to medium rare, just as we'd requested as well. 
Unlike the steak, the baked potato simply was not good. It was just that: a baked potato, with sour cream, no other additions or seasoning. 
After we had gorged ourselves on the meat, we perused the dessert menu quickly, but decided not to order anything. However, I was then surprised by the waiters coming out with a small sundae and candle and singing happy birthday. It was a lovely end to a delicious meal. They seemed to be used to this, as it was about the 5th rendition of it that night.
Would recommend and return for an amazing steak dinner.","","3/5/2019","Believe the hype. 
I was lucky enough to be taken here for my birthday dinner. This place is the real deal. Peter Luger is one of New York's longest running restaurants, having been established in 1887. After trying the food, it is understandably so. 
My friend made a reservation here (by phone only) a few weeks beforehand, and was only able to get a reservation at 5:45pm on a Sunday. She called a few days before the reservation to change it to a party of three, which they were able to accommodate. 
We arrived promptly at 5:45pm on the day of our reservation, and stepped into a long hall, reminiscent of a German beer hall. My friend was at the host's desk already, and after confirming our reservation, we were told to wait over near the bar.

You can choose your toppings from a fairly small selection for your pie, or order a calzone. We got pepperoni on our pizza and the 4 cheese calzone. The pizza was excellent, very fresh ingredients, but the star was definitely the calzone, which was the perfect mix of chewy dough and decadent cheese.

My girlfriend and I split the burrata & eggplant appetizer and the Brussels sprouts salad. I could eat the burrata & eggplant for the rest of my life and not be bored. The Brussels sprouts salad was dressed in a lemon vinaigrette that struck the right balance. I had the pork medallions with fontina. It was tender and delicious, and a good sized portion as well. My girlfriend ordered the short ribs and when they came with garlic-potato puree, which we didn't notice (and don't eat), the waitress quickly whisked the plate away and brought it back with fresh vegetables, no questions asked. The short ribs, by the way were melt-in-your-mouth excellent.

It's a small place that doesn't take reservations for less than parties of 4. So if it's date night, I would be prepared to wait a few minutes. Luckily we didn't have to. We were seated immediately and the service, as evidenced above, was outstanding.

We started off with the fresh rolls, which felt like I had a slight taste of summer in my mouth as the veggies were so fresh & the roll itself was so delicious. It was accompanied by the most melt in the mouth peanut dip -- oh my! I got the fried chicken & waffles and my husband got the spicy shrimp pho. We were both happy with our dishes. I was especially happy with the waffle , which was so ridiculously delicious.
We also got the vietnamese iced coffee, which I highly liked and recommend.
Overall Bricolage is great, do try it for brunch. I wish to be back here for dinner someday.","","2/24/2019","I am usually disappointed in many brunch spots across the city, but Bricolage is exceedingly good!

We sat at the bar, which actually is a really nice
Area to eat, and the bartender slash server was very attentive. 

Our favorites were the Squash Rings, the Rutabaga Tagliatelle (Delish!), and Dave's Trout. I could have lived without the Carrot Crepe and the Lobster Thermidor-didn't really knock my socks off like the first three. Dessert was great too, forgot what we had tho!","","3/5/2019","Been dying to go here, and finally came up with a plan since it's so difficult to get a reservation here-we went at 4:50pm figuring we could sit at the bar.
